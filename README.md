# Omicron – Cybersecurity & Offensive/Defensive Operations Framework

Welcome to **Omicron**, a powerful, modular cybersecurity and operational framework designed to enable teams to safely simulate, monitor, and interact with complex digital environments. This repository serves as the central hub for all Omicron-related development, documentation, and collaborative contributions under the guidance of the **Cyber OC Team**.

Omicron is built around a philosophy of **auditability, safety, and versatility**, combining offensive, defensive, and experimental capabilities into a unified platform. It empowers developers, security researchers, and ethical hackers to design, test, and execute scenarios in controlled, reproducible environments without risking live infrastructure.

## Overview

Omicron is a **comprehensive cyber operations ecosystem** designed for research, training, and controlled experiments. The system is built to support three main pillars of cybersecurity practice:

1. **Defensive Operations** – proactive network monitoring, threat detection, and forensic logging.  
2. **Offensive Operations** – honeypots, attack simulations, and controlled adversarial testing in sandboxed environments.  
3. **Development & Automation** – modular coding, task scheduling, reproducible experiments, and secure data management.  

Omicron integrates a proprietary **Omicron Programming Language** (OPL) that simplifies complex operations through readable syntax while maintaining flexibility and expressiveness. Users can define tasks, spawn virtual devices, run network flows, and perform cryptographic operations with minimal boilerplate code.

The system emphasizes **auditability**, with all operations logged immutably for traceability and legal compliance. Advanced users can integrate Omicron modules to orchestrate end-to-end simulations, including hardware-in-the-loop testing, IoT emulations, and ML-assisted policy evaluations.

## Core Philosophy

Omicron is guided by the following principles:

- **Safety First:** All potentially dangerous operations run in a controlled environment (sentinel.lab) to prevent accidental damage.  
- **Auditability:** Immutable logs and cryptographically signed events ensure tamper-proof traceability.  
- **Extensibility:** Modular design allows new features, honeypots, and scripts to be added without disrupting core functionality.  
- **Reproducibility:** Every scenario can be recreated for testing, training, or forensic validation.  
- **Collaboration-Friendly:** Designed for multi-member teams with clear roles, responsibilities, and contribution paths.  
- **Ethical Enforcement:** Offensive capabilities are always designed to operate in sandboxed or lab-only conditions to ensure ethical compliance.

## Modules & Libraries

Omicron includes over 100 specialized libraries and modules, each designed for a unique operational function. Below are some of the key modules:

### 1. Shadow.Core
- **Purpose:** Deterministic tasks, immutable state, scheduled jobs.  
- **API:** `task`, `spawn`, `State`  
- **Example:**  
```opl
task heartbeat() { 
  State cnt = 0; 
  loop { 
    cnt += 1; 
    audit.log("hb", cnt); 
    sleep(1m); 
  } 
}
